This is my personal collection of (however slightly) modified `.tmLanguage` syntax definition files for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com), both versions [2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and [3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). They are provided without any warranty, and no license, as in most cases they're directly modified from what ships with Sublime. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MattDMo/sublime-languages/issues/new) if you want, but I may not be able to help you.

For an "official" supported syntax, check out my [Python Improved](https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved) project, which aims to be a much better replacement to the current `Python.tmLanguage` file.
